<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Oluwafunmilola(Funmi) Adebiyi, and I am an aspiring web developer or data scientist. I have a love for 
  learning new things, and I am trying to dabble into a few different things so I am sure as to what I want to do in the future
  I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria but went to boarding school in the United Kingdom from 2018. 
  My passion for Computer Science grew over time as I was surrounded by the lack of thereof and wanted to help people
  that weren't able to help themselves, and therefore led me to want to pursue a career in Computer Science.</p>

<p>I am currently in sixth form and I will be completing my last year of school starting September 2024, and hopefully going 
  to university Autumn 2025. I am currently studying Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science, and Physics. From my different subjects
  I have acquired the skill of breaking down a problem before trying to attempt it. </p>

<p>When I am not doing school work, I am probably engrossed in a new book, curled up in my bed or looking for a new ravishing
  brownie recipe. I am always looking for new ways to grow both intellectually and mentally - professionally and personally.  
  Feel free to reach out to me whether it is giving good advice and tips or discussing basic interests..</p>
